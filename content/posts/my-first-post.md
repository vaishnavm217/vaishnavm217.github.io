Personal websites have become too mainstream. Full of how "much lines I have coded" and all the fancy stuff to show their skills. I feel that resume or CV are meant for that. Personal website about what you love to do, blogs, pictures, studies which you find facinating.
If I have time ( and given that I don't get bored), I might put up lots of easter eggs in this website. For now this is the first post so there won't be any spoilers for the challenge. Get hyped and wait for next posts.
