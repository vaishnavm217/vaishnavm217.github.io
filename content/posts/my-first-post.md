Personal websites have become too mainstream. Full of how “much lines I have coded” and all the fancy stuff to show their skills. I feel that resume or CV are meant for that. A personal website about what you love to do, blogs, pictures, studies which you find fascinating. If I have time ( and given that I don’t get bored ), I will put up posts about my experience in Sri City and my life as a coder. Moreover of easter eggs will be hidden in this website. For now, Find the easter egg hidden here.
Get hyped and wait for next posts.
